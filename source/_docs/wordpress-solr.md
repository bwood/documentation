[Apache Solr](/docs/solr) is a system for indexing and searching site content. Currently, all plans except for a Personal plan can use Solr.

First, you will need to add the Index Server to your site. From your Dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Add Ons** > **Apache Solr Index Server: Add**. This will provision Apache Solr containers for every environment for your site. You are now ready to begin integrating with WordPress.

## Solr Search for WordPress
Pantheon supports and maintains [Solr Search for WordPress (Solr Power)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/solr-power/).  This plugin replaces the [default search mechanism](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Search_Parameter) within WordPress while preserving the familiar integration methods within themes and widgets.


## Install and Configure Plugin
1. [Set the connection mode to SFTP](/docs/sftp) for the Dev or Multidev environment via the Pantheon Dashboard or with [Terminus](/docs/terminus/):
 ```bash
 terminus site set-connection-mode --mode=sftp
 ```

2. Install and activate the [Solr Search for WordPress (Solr Power)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/solr-power/) plugin on the Dev or Multidev environment using the WordPress Dashboard or with Terminus:
 ```bash
 terminus wp 'plugin install --activate solr-power'
 ```
 Upon activation, the plugin will generate and send a [`schema.xml`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power/blob/master/schema.xml) document to the Solr server.
3. From the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **Settings** > **Solr Options**. You should see your site's Solr Server details within the **Info** tab.
4. Select the **Indexing** tab and configure desired indexing options for Solr. Click **Save Changes** after making modifications.
 <div class="alert alert-info">
 <h4>Note</h4> You can exclude pages or posts from being indexed by providing the numeric ID of the item (comma separated).
 </div>
5. Index all publicly queryable post types by navigating to the **Actions** tab and clicking **Execute** next to "Index Searchable Post Types", or via Terminus:

 ```bash
 terminus wp 'solr index'
 ```

6. Use the **Query** tab to quickly validate Solr's indexing configuration. You can also install and activate the [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) plugin to debug and validate Solr queries (optional):

7. Deploy the plugin to the site's Live environment after validation and testing. The `schema.xml` file must be sent to Solr when the plugin is deployed to another environment for the first time. Select **Repost schema.xml** from the **Actions** tab, then validate expected results.

### Optimize Index
For details, see the [Optimize command](http://solarium.readthedocs.org/en/stable/queries/update-query/building-an-update-query/optimize-command/) document.

## Known Issues/Limitations
This plugin is under active development on [GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power). Use the issue queue for status updates and support. Pull requests are also welcome!

### Re-Indexing
New, deleted, and modified posts and pages are automatically added to the Solr index. However, if you modify the indexing options within **Settings** > **Solr Options** > **Indexing**, you must manually re-index the site on the **Actions** tab.
### Initial Deploy to Test and Live
The `schema.xml` file is not automatically sent to Solr when deploying the plugin to another environment for the first time. Login to the WordPress Dashboard on the environment's URL and click **Repost schema.xml** within  **Settings** > **Solr Options** > **Actions**. Then re-index the site.

This is required upon initial deployment of the plugin to any environment or when a custom `schema.xml` document is changed.
### Enable Solr for AJAX and WordPress Dashboard
Use the `solr_allow_ajax` and the `solr_allow_admin` filters to allow Solr to work with AJAX and within the WordPress Dashboard.
